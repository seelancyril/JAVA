The File class is Java’s representation of a file or directory path name. 
Because file and directory names have different formats on different platforms, 
a simple string is not adequate to name them. The File class contains several methods for working with the path name,
 deleting and renaming files, creating new directories, listing the contents of a directory,
  and determining several common attributes of files and directories.
